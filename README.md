Wait... what is a Koza? It is a sheep in [Polish](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/koza#Polish).

KozaJudge is a basic (also probably stupid) solutions checker for Python excerises. Made by :heart: for [Unical](https://www.unical.it) first year [Computer Science](https://informatica.unical.it/) students. 

## How to use it

Before downloading the repository, organise your exercises and solutions folder. 
One folder for the exercises and the second one for the solutions.

The structure of the solutions folder is this:
```
solutions/
├── excerise1/
│   ├── excerise1_1.in
│   ├── excerise1_1.out
│   ├── excerise1_2.in
│   └── excerise1_2.out
├── excerise2/
│   ├── excerise2_1.in
│   ├── excerise2_1.out
```
For each testcase there is a file with {name_excerise}\_{testcase_number}.in and {name_excerise}_{testcase_number}.out

After that, clone the repository and follow the istructions' program.


## To do List: 

If you would like to contribute to this project, here there is a list of things to do.

- Deploy it as a Python Package or make it able to install it on local machine (or maybe make a GUI).

- Insert a sort of guide before entering the paths in the setup. 

- Create a sort of debug mode for us

- Test it on windows. (I'm worried about the paths...)

- Make a decent logo.

- Add license
